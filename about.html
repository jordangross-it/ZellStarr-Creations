        <h2>About my journey</h2>
        <p>
            I began my Sims building journey in 2015, when EA finally brought The Sims 4 to Mac. Almost immediately,
            I discovered a passion for interior design and creating imaginative builds in a variety of styles. At first…
            well,
            I wasn’t very good—but that’s how it starts for all of us! Over time, and after countless hours in The Sims
            4,
            my designs and builds have grown and improved into what I’m proud to share today.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Nowadays, I love exploring almost every design style imaginable! From contemporary and Tudor to
            Dutch-Colonial—even
            outlandish builds like castles or homes for aliens. There’s immense joy in thinking carefully through every
            choice
            that goes into a build. From every potted plant to every accent wall, the journey to a finished creation can
            be wild—but
            it’s always incredibly satisfying to see it come together.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            A huge thank you to my inspirations—YouTubers Deligracy, Lilsimsie, and James Turner—who taught me so much
            and guided
            me along my Sims journey. I’m also incredibly grateful for every kind comment, like, and interaction on my
            gallery posts.
            Your support makes building and sharing my creations even more rewarding!
        </p>
